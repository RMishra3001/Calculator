This calculator project was created by me as a learning exercise in web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This project is a simple yet functional calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator interface is designed to be user-friendly and responsive, allowing seamless use on both desktop and mobile devices.

Responsive Design: Adjusts seamlessly to different screen sizes using CSS Flexbox and media queries.
Clear Functionality: Includes a clear button to reset calculations.

Technologies Used:
HTML: Provides the structure and semantic markup.
CSS: Styles the calculator layout and ensures responsiveness.
JavaScript: Implements the calculator logic and handles user interactions.

Project Structure:
index.html: Contains the HTML structure of the calculator.
style.css: Defines the styles for the calculator layout and responsiveness.
